# Intro
This morning I was reminded about the importance of patching. When I woke up I had an email from github stating that they had found a vulnerability in one of my repositories with a high severity. Not really ideal news to wake up to.

## The vulnerability
The vulnerability affects the gem kramdown with versions before 2.3 and allows unintended read access or unintended embedded code execution with Ruby. [NIST CVE-2020-14001](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14001)

## Patching 
To patch this vulnerability first check the version of kramdown using the following:
~~~
gem list
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This gives ous the version for installed gems, in this case the culprit: 
~~~
kramdown (1.17.0)
~~~
{: .language-bash}

To update every gem we simply issue:
~~~
gem update
~~~
{: .language-bash}

A new listing of installed gems:
~~~
gem list
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Confirms that the new version is installed:
~~~
kramdown (2.3.0, 1.17.0)
~~~
{: .language-bash}

To get rid of the old versions of gems one can use the following:
~~~
gem cleanup
~~~
{: .language-bash}

And finally a new listing:
~~~
gem list
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Which confirms that the old version of the gem containing the vulnerability is gone:
~~~
kramdown (2.3.0)
~~~
