# Intro to Bandit
Bandit is a small CTF-like wargame from [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) aimed at both hacking and Linux novices. The goal is to via SSH connect to each level, retrieve the flag and use that as the password for the next level.

Each level on the website has useful hints about the commands the user can use to solve the challenge, or links to wiki-pages or man-pages that the user can consult to learn more. This is one of the greatest things about it as you are forced to read up if you get stuck, as a result one can learn a great deal from these challenges!

To this day the game has 33 levels which are active and users are encouraged to make own levels and submit. As the challenges are active I will not post any flags or guides on how to solve the levels, as the maintainers do not want this. 

## The challenges
I first encountered Bandit a couple of years ago when I started studying IT, did a few levels before the studies got in the way and I forgot about it. But now it was time to finally work my way through each level!

The first 15 levels or so took about an hour, after that each level could take a few minutes each up to one hour when I got stuck. It progressively gets harder and harder and I learned a great deal of tricks along the way!

During the challengers I befriended both `netcat` and `git` which I haven't used that much before.

The only downside about the challenges where that at times the hints are to obvious and to extensive, but then again the challenges are aimed at total beginners,
