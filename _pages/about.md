# Me
I'm a 26 year old former student living in Ume√•, Sweden. Most recentcly I studied a two year long university program about network operations at Mittuniversitetet in Sundsvall.
The program was divided in one network part where we took us through CCNA, CCNP and some courses regarding network security and network analysis. The other part of the program was focused on system administration and scripting in Unix enviroments, with some courses in IT-security and web development. 

Before this I studied standalone courses for about a year in computer technology, web development, some programming in C#, web server programming (mainly mySQL) and some courses regarding network technology and communication technology.     

During these years of studies I've also spent many hours with my small homelab on the side, experimenting and setting up services. As well as nurturing my interest for IT-security with mostly studies, but more recently also by engaging in CTF's and getting more hands on experience. 

# This blog
The blog is mainly for logging the work I put into projects, codes or challenges. Because when I'm not only doing the project but also forcing myself to explain it, that's when I really learn about it. 
It could also work as an extension of my CV if a future employer wants to know what I can do and what I really do on my free time.
